# Jekyll with Sass and CoffeeScript

This project contains a light-weight setup I use for building static sites. It is
built upon the wonderful [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with support for
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

## Installation

To get started, clone this project, install the dependencies and setup Jekyll:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:thejspr/jekyll-scaffold.git my-new-site
cd my-new-site
bundle install
./bin/setup
```

## Development and site building

Once all dependencies are installed, start a development server with `jekyll serve --watch`

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

When you want to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, run `./bin/release`

## Contributing

1. Implement your feature/fix or create an issue.
2. Send a Pull-Request.
3. Bathe in the glory of open-source software.
